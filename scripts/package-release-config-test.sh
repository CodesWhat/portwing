# Catches the next replacement service without having to know its name. This is
# a regression guard, not an adversary control: it reads the markup literally,
# so a deliberately entity-encoded host (warpchart&#46;dev) would slip past it.
# Worth knowing, not worth an HTML decoder in shell.
#
# Deliberately not restricted to <img src>, and deliberately not a list of
# attribute names either. Any attribute pointing at an external host is a
# third-party request from this section — data-src is fetched by lazy-loaders,
# <object data=> and <use href=> load too — and enumerating the attributes
# worth checking is the same mistake as enumerating the hosts worth rejecting:
# it only ever covers the ones already thought of. A reject is the one place
# where matching too much is the safe direction, so this matches any attribute
# whose value is an external URL. The quote handling covers the three legal
# forms (double, single, bare) and the optional scheme covers protocol-relative
# //host references. Prose URLs in this section are unaffected: they have no
# preceding `=`.
#
# One carve-out, and it is a distinction rather than an exception: the shape
# wraps the chart in a link to the stargazers page, so an <a href> to an
# external host is expected here. A link is navigation the reader chooses, not
# a resource the browser fetches on render, so it leaks no visitor IP and is
# not what this check is about. Neutralising href only on <a> open tags keeps
# every other element in scope, so <use href>, <object data> and data-src are
# still caught. Exempting the stargazers URL by name instead would have been an
# allow-list of one, which is the enumeration mistake described above.
#
# The url(...) alternation is not decoration: an external reference inside a CSS
# value is not preceded by `=`, so style="background:url(//host/x.png)" slipped
# the attribute pattern entirely. Found by mutation, not by reading it back —
# the comment here previously claimed that case was covered when it was not.
