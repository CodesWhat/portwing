# Self-test for scripts/starchart-config-test.sh. Each case breaks the real
# workflow in one specific way and asserts the contract rejects it with the
# message that names that specific breakage. A contract nobody has watched
# fail is a contract nobody knows works.
#
# Three rounds of review turned scripts/starchart-config-test.sh from "match
# a few key lines" into a thicket of exact-indent regexes, awk state
# machines, and allowlists, and this file grew a mutation for every bypass
# each round closed. A fourth round replaced all of that with a golden
# template: the exact expected contents of starchart.yml, embedded in the
# contract script, compared to the real file line by line. Under that model,
# almost all of the earlier mutations exercise the exact same mechanism --
# "an extra or changed line fails structurally, whatever it says" -- and
# produce the literal same message, because the contract no longer looks at
# what a line SAYS, only whether it matches. Where several old mutations now
# collapse to one indistinguishable assertion, this file keeps one
# representative case and says so in a comment, rather than asserting the
# same string ten times over.
#
# A fifth round found the line-by-line comparison itself had two blind
# spots: a NUL byte is silently dropped by `read`, and a missing final
# newline has no line to differ on. The contract's actual gate is now a byte
# comparison (`cmp -s` against the template rendered with the real file's
# own slot values); the line walk only explains a cmp failure afterward, so
# this file also asserts the exact fail-closed messages for the two byte-
# level cases a line comparison alone would have missed, and for
# renovate.json being absent or unusable.
#
# A sixth round closed the gap the fifth round's own line-based comparison
# still had one level down: `read` only splits on \n, but YAML also treats
# U+0085 (NEL), U+2028, and U+2029 as line breaks, so a NEL or line/paragraph
# separator hidden inside the pin's trailing comment used to read as one
# line here while a YAML parser reads it as two. The contract now asserts
# the whole file is printable ASCII plus LF as an explicit, file-wide check,
# which happens to run early enough that it also now catches the NUL-byte
# mutation below directly, by name, rather than by the byte-gate's generic
# fallback. The renovate.json cross-check also moved off an untested
# STARCHART_RENOVATE_JSON override and onto the workflow argument's own
# directory, and onto a single exact jq array-equality check in place of a
# two-step extract-then-compare, so the fixture tree below now mirrors the
# real repo's layout (workflow nested under .github/workflows/, renovate.json
# at the root next to it) instead of a flat directory the old override
# happened to resolve against.
#
# assert_rejected now matches the FULL "FAIL: ..." line by exact string
# equality, not a substring anywhere in the output. A substring match would
# have let a message drift (an interpolated value silently going missing, a
# line number silently wrong) past this file unnoticed, as long as some
# fixed fragment of the original wording still happened to appear somewhere.
# Exact-line matching means every assertion below is transcribed verbatim
# from what the contract actually printed for that exact mutation, not
# reconstructed from memory of what it was supposed to say.
#
# The three slots -- @PIN@, @PIN_COMMENT@, @BRANCH@ -- are the only positions
# the template lets vary, and they keep their own specific messages: a
# malformed pin is still "must be a full 40-hex commit SHA...", a bad branch
# is still "must not be main/master/HEAD/empty" or "must match this repo's
# dev/vX.Y convention" or the renovate.json cross-check, not a generic
# deviation. Deleting the branch: line entirely, though, is not a slot
# mutation: with no line left at that position to extract a branch value
# from, it is purely a structural deviation, caught by the byte gate on its
# own terms.
#
# The contract cross-checks branch: against renovate.json's baseBranchPatterns,
# so this fixture tree carries its own copy to stay hermetic -- no reading the
# real repo's renovate.json from a temp directory that isn't it.
