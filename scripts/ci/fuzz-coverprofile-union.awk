# Merge N `go test -covermode=set -coverprofile=...` profiles into one
# statement-coverage percentage.
#
# Called two ways from this repository:
#
#   * scripts/ci/fuzz-score.sh, with exactly one profile, to score a single
#     fuzz target's corpus replay;
#   * quality-fuzz-nightly.yml's `history` job, with every target's profile
#     from the run, to compute the union row's `union_coverage_pct` across
#     the whole matrix.
#
# Every non-header line is `block numstmts count`, where `block` is
# `file:startline.col,endline.col`. The same block can appear in more than
# one input file only when two fuzz targets share a package (this repo has
# one such pair: FuzzParsePHC and FuzzParseTrustedProxies, both in
# ./internal/server/), and a block covered by either target's replay is
# covered — so the merge keys on the block spec and keeps the max count seen
# for it, never a sum and never last-write-wins. numstmts for a given block
# is identical everywhere it appears (the compiler emits the same block
# table regardless of which binary is running it), so the first sighting is
# kept rather than re-summed.
#
# Usage: awk -f fuzz-coverprofile-union.awk profile1.out [profile2.out ...]
# Output: one line, the merged percentage formatted to two decimal places.
