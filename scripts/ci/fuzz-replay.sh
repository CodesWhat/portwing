# Seed-replay tier (PW-7.37): runs a fuzz target's committed seed corpus plus
# the cached (GOCACHE) corpus through `go test -run`, with no `-fuzz` budget
# at all. FuzzParseImageRef and FuzzParseLabels are saturated — 5.5M and 6.8M
# executions logged with zero new interesting inputs, and their path
# derivation was independently verified correct, so this is real saturation
# rather than a bug. Fuzzing them further spends nightly minutes finding
# nothing while targets that still produce (FuzzMCPHandler, FuzzEnvelope,
# FuzzComposeRequestValidate) get the same budget. They still run every
# night — this still catches a regression in the committed corpus — just
# without generating new input. See
# quality-fuzz-nightly.yml's "Replay ${{ matrix.fuzzer.name }}" step for the
# caller and scripts/fuzz-tier-config-test.sh's `replay_tier_fuzzers` for the
# pinned tier membership.
#
# The cached-<basename> copy trick is the one scripts/ci/fuzz-score.sh uses
# to make a `-run` replay see the GOCACHE corpus (`go test -run` only reads
# testdata/fuzz/<Target>/, not the fuzz engine's own cache — `-test.fuzz-
# cachedir` is set only when `-test.fuzz` is). Reimplemented here rather than
# shared as a library function: fuzz-score.sh's own cleanup runs from an EXIT
# trap that must never fail its caller (that step runs `if: always()`),
# while this script's entire purpose is to fail its caller on a regression.
#
# Usage: fuzz-replay.sh <pkg> <target> <generated-dir> <seed-dir>
#
#   <pkg>            go test package argument, e.g. ./internal/adapter/
#   <target>         fuzz target name, e.g. FuzzParseImageRef
#   <generated-dir>  $GOCACHE/fuzz/<module>/<pkgdir>/<Target>, the engine's
#                    own corpus cache (steps.corpus.outputs.generated). May
#                    be empty or missing on a cold cache; the replay then
#                    just runs the committed seed corpus.
#   <seed-dir>       <pkg>/testdata/fuzz/<Target>, git-tracked
#                    (steps.corpus.outputs.seed)
#
# Env:
#   FUZZ_TIMEOUT      passed as `go test -timeout`; omitted when unset, so
#                      `go test`'s own default applies
#   FUZZ_OUTPUT_FILE  appended with `kind=`, `reason=` (crash/error only) and
#                      `status=` lines, the same shape scripts/ci/fuzz-run.sh
#                      writes — point this at $GITHUB_OUTPUT to feed the same
#                      downstream Score/Summarize/history steps its callers
#                      use. kind is "replay" on a clean pass, never "pass" —
#                      that value stays reserved for a run that actually
#                      spent -fuzz minutes.
#
# Classification (mirrors scripts/ci/fuzz-score.sh's own build-error /
# stale-cache / crash distinction, ~line 49 of that script):
#
#   1. The package's tests are compiled without running
#      (`go test -run '^$' -count=1 <pkg>`) before anything is copied. A
#      failure here is the package itself, not the corpus — kind=error,
#      reason=build.
#   2. The seed-plus-cached corpus is then replayed. A non-zero exit whose
#      output matches one of Go's own corpus-decode error strings —
#      "cannot unmarshal", "mismatched types in corpus entry", "wrong
#      number of values in corpus entry" (internal/fuzz/encoding.go,
#      internal/fuzz/fuzz.go's CheckCorpus) — means some corpus entry's
#      shape no longer matches this target's current f.Add/Fuzz signature.
#      Go's own error names the failing file's path in double quotes
#      ("testdata/fuzz/<Target>/<name>": <reason>); this script parses
#      that path out of the replay log to tell which kind of entry it was:
#        - basename starts with "cached-" (this run's own copy of a
#          GOCACHE entry): kind=error, reason=stale-cache. That entry
#          would otherwise be saved again under the next cache key by
#          "Save fuzz corpus" below, so this script also deletes the
#          stale entries from the generated (GOCACHE) corpus dir before
#          exiting — the save step then writes a fresh cache instead of
#          repeating the same broken one every night.
#        - any other basename (a git-tracked seed under testdata/fuzz/):
#          kind=error, reason=seed-decode. A committed seed can't be
#          healed by clearing GOCACHE; it needs a source fix, so this is
#          reported distinctly rather than folded into stale-cache, where
#          it would never self-heal and would keep failing forever.
#      If both kinds of entry fail in the same run, seed-decode wins:
#      clearing the cache can't fix it, so it needs to surface.
#   3. Any other non-zero exit is the one thing a seed-replay can otherwise
#      mean: a previously-passing committed (or cached) entry now fails.
#      kind=crash, reason=seed-regression.
#
# Reproduction: on a replay failure (case 2 or 3 above), this run's
# cached-<basename> copies are saved to fuzz-replay-failure/<target>/ at the
# workspace root before the EXIT trap removes them from testdata — the
# nightly's failure-path corpus upload picks that directory up alongside
# testdata/fuzz/<target>/ (quality-fuzz-nightly.yml's "Upload fuzz corpus on
# failure or cancel" step), since a failing GOCACHE entry is never committed
# and would otherwise vanish the moment this script exits. The trap still
# removes every cached-* copy from testdata unconditionally, so the score
# step's cleanup guard and "Save fuzz corpus" never see them.
#
# Exit codes: 0 pass (kind=replay), 1 regression in the committed corpus
# (kind=crash, reason=seed-regression), 2 setup/classification error
# (kind=error, reason=build|stale-cache|corpus-copy).
