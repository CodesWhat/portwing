# Append one scheduled quality lane's headline numbers to the repository's
# `quality-history` orphan branch.
#
# Usage: quality-history-append.sh <lane> [<json-object>]
#
#   <lane>         soak | mutation | mutation-survivors | fuzz-nightly | bench.
#                  Names the JSONL file on the orphan branch (`<lane>.jsonl`).
#   <json-object>  A single JSON object of that lane's numbers, passed inline.
#                  The common envelope (run id, attempt, workflow, event, sha,
#                  UTC timestamp) is added here so every lane records it the
#                  same way, and it wins on a key collision so a lane can't
#                  overwrite `run_id` with something of its own. Omit this
#                  and set QUALITY_HISTORY_RECORD_FILE instead when the
#                  record might be large (see below): passing it inline goes
#                  through the OS's own argv, which caps a single argument at
#                  128 KiB on Linux (MAX_ARG_STRLEN) well under the 1 MiB a
#                  mutation-survivors record can reach.
#
# Why an orphan branch rather than a file on dev/main: the house rule is that
# committed generated artifacts change at a release cut and nowhere else, so a
# cron job that rewrites a tracked file on dev would mutate the tree underneath
# a tag. An orphan branch shares the repository (no new repo, no new secret)
# while sitting outside every released tree — `git log dev/v0.9` never sees it,
# a release archive never contains it, and a checkout never carries its weight.
#
# Why a temporary clone rather than the checkout in the workspace: the lanes
# check out with `persist-credentials: false`, and the workspace holds the
# lane's own build. A throwaway single-branch clone keeps the credential and
# the history commit entirely out of the job's working tree, and it is removed
# on exit.
#
# This never fails the caller. History is a trend surface, not a gate: an
# append that can't reach the remote must not turn a green quality lane red, or
# the mechanism that exists to make a slow regression visible becomes a new way
# to hide one. Every failure exits 0 behind a `::warning::` annotation.
#
# Environment overrides (all optional; the defaults are the CI values):
#   QUALITY_HISTORY_REMOTE          git remote to push to
#                                   (default https://github.com/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY.git)
#   QUALITY_HISTORY_BRANCH          branch name (default quality-history)
#   QUALITY_HISTORY_CREDENTIAL      credential for the HTTPS remote; on CI this
#                                   is ${{ github.token }}. Omitted for a local
#                                   filesystem remote.
#   QUALITY_HISTORY_PUSH_ATTEMPTS   CAS attempts before giving up (default 20)
#   QUALITY_HISTORY_EVENT           event name to gate on (default $GITHUB_EVENT_NAME)
#   QUALITY_HISTORY_TIMESTAMP       fixed record timestamp. Exists so the
#                                   duplicate-suppression path below can be
#                                   tested: it needs two invocations that
#                                   produce a byte-identical record.
#   QUALITY_HISTORY_RETAIN          keep only the newest N records in this
#                                   lane's file, applied after every append.
#                                   Unset means today's behaviour for every
#                                   lane: unbounded. A value below 1 is
#                                   refused (a warning, pruning skipped for
#                                   that invocation; the append itself still
#                                   happens).
#   QUALITY_HISTORY_RETAIN_BYTES    byte ceiling enforced alongside RETAIN,
#                                   default 1048576 (1 MiB) once RETAIN is
#                                   set. Whole oldest records are dropped
#                                   until the file fits or only the newest
#                                   record remains; the newest record is
#                                   never dropped, even if it alone exceeds
#                                   the ceiling (a `::warning::` is emitted
#                                   instead). A value below 1 is refused the
#                                   same way RETAIN is: a warning, no byte
#                                   ceiling enforced for that invocation.
#   QUALITY_HISTORY_RECORD_FILE     path to a file holding the lane's numbers
#                                   as a single JSON object, read instead of
#                                   the <json-object> argument. Never placed
#                                   on argv anywhere downstream: the record
#                                   is read with `jq --slurpfile`, and the
#                                   push-time duplicate check reads it back
#                                   with `grep -f` rather than passing it as
#                                   a pattern argument, so a record up to the
#                                   spec's 1 MiB ceiling never has to fit in
#                                   a single argv string.

# quality-history

Machine-written trend data for Portwing's scheduled quality lanes. One
append-only JSONL file per lane, one record per lane run:

| File | Lane | Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| `soak.jsonl` | `quality-soak-weekly.yml` | weekly |
| `mutation.jsonl` | `quality-mutation-monthly.yml` | monthly, one record per matrix package |
| `mutation-survivors.jsonl` | `quality-mutation-monthly.yml` | monthly, one record per run, capped to the newest 12 |
| `fuzz-nightly.jsonl` | `quality-fuzz-nightly.yml` | nightly |
| `bench.jsonl` | `quality-bench-monthly.yml` | monthly |

This is an orphan branch. It shares no history with `main` or any `dev/*`
branch, it is never merged, and nothing here is part of a release. Records are
written by `scripts/ci/quality-history-append.sh` on the trunk branches; read
them with `scripts/quality-history.sh <lane> [--last N]`.

Every record carries the same envelope: `lane`, `timestamp` (UTC), `workflow`,
`event`, `run_id`, `run_attempt`, `run_number`, `sha`, `ref`. The remaining
keys are the lane's own headline numbers.

Only `schedule` and `workflow_dispatch` runs append. Rewriting history here is
safe: nothing depends on these commits, and the branch can be deleted and
allowed to bootstrap itself again.
