# Propose mutation floor ratchets from this run's per-package records and the
# quality-history series, without writing anything back to the repository.
#
# The `ratchet` job in quality-mutation-monthly.yml stays `contents: read`:
# raising a floor is a two-file lockstep edit (the matrix in that workflow and
# `expectedFloors` in scripts/mutation-config.test.mjs) plus a per-package
# prose comment, and that edit belongs in a reviewed PR, not a scheduled job
# holding write access. This script only ever proposes.
#
# Usage: mutation-ratchet.sh <records-dir> <history.jsonl> <out.json>
#
#   <records-dir>   Directory of downloaded mutation-history-*-<run_id>
#                    artifacts, one subdirectory per package, each holding a
#                    quality-history-record.json (always) and, for a package
#                    that measured ("gated" mode), a mutation-survivors.json.
#   <history.jsonl>  The quality-history branch's mutation.jsonl, or a path
#                    that does not exist / is empty on the branch's first run.
#   <out.json>       Where the proposal document is written.
#
# Per package, per metric (efficacy, mutator_coverage):
#
#   pool    = this run's measured value, plus up to the 6 most recent prior
#             mutation.jsonl rows for that package with mode == "gated" and
#             outcome == "success". "Prior" is enforced by run id, not by
#             position: the `history` job appends this run's own rows to the
#             branch before this job checks it out, so without that filter
#             the newest slot in the 6-row window holds a duplicate of the
#             current measurement and silently evicts the oldest real prior,
#             raising basis and shrinking the buffer.
#
#             PW-7.36: a row (this run's own, or a prior one carrying the
#             same killed/lived/timed_out counts) that timed out any mutants
#             does not enter the efficacy pool as Gremlins' own reported
#             value. It is recomputed as killed / (killed + lived +
#             timed_out), i.e. every timed-out mutant is added to the
#             sample and credited to neither side -- never counted as
#             killed -- instead of being dropped from the ratio the way
#             Gremlins' own killed/(killed+lived) drops it. That can only
#             pull the pool value down or leave it unchanged, so a package
#             that timed out mutants can never ratchet a floor higher than a
#             clean run would have. mutator_coverage is not adjusted:
#             Gremlins counts a timed-out mutant as covered (a test did run
#             against it), so it costs nothing there. A history row that
#             timed out mutants but is missing killed or lived cannot be
#             recomputed at all, so it cannot be trusted to have been
#             discounted -- it is dropped from the pool instead of falling
#             back to its raw (undiscounted) efficacy, and the drop is
#             counted in the proposal's discarded_rows.
#   basis   = min(pool). Never the best run in the pool -- a ratchet built
#             from the best run would relock the very slack PW-6.1 exists to
#             catch.
#   buffer  = max(1.0, max(pool) - min(pool), seed). `seed` covers two
#             packages (adapter-drydock, metrics) whose run-to-run spread is
#             documented in the workflow's own matrix comments but is not yet
#             reflected in quality-history, because recording started after
#             their floors were set; the seed floors the buffer until real
#             samples overtake it.
#   proposed = basis - buffer, floored (not rounded) to two decimals so a
#             proposal never sits a hundredth above what the pool actually
#             supports, and so it round-trips through mutation-gate.sh's own
#             hundredths comparison.
#
# A proposal is only emitted when proposed clears the current floor by at
# least 2.00 and is strictly above it -- never a lower or equal value. A
# package is skipped entirely (not proposed, not silently dropped) when its
# own run this cycle was not a clean gated measurement: mode != "gated",
# outcome != "success", its timed-out mutants exceed 5% of the mutants it
# attempted (reason "timed-out-over-tolerance", the counts that produced the
# decision recorded alongside it), or neither metric has a readable pool.
# Up to that 5% tolerance a timed-out mutant no longer skips the package on
# its own -- see the pool comment above for how it is kept from raising a
# floor instead.
