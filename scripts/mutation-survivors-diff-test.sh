# that went from "measured" to "missing" (the live 98-mutant advisory
# outage) must not read as 98 fresh kills, and a whole-file insertion that
# shifts every mutant's window must not read as 0 persisted survivors
# mislabelled as killed-and-new when nothing was actually fixed.

# --- a whole-file insertion above every mutant: zero kills, zero new --------
#
# Every mutant's line number shifts down by the same amount a real editor
# insertion would produce, and the 5-line window re-identifies each one at
# its new line (this is the documented open risk: a real code change here
# would read the same way). What this asserts is narrower: an insertion
# that does not touch any mutant's own window content must not manufacture
# spurious kills or news out of thin air when the ids are literally
# unchanged (same a, same o, same everything) because nothing shifted.
