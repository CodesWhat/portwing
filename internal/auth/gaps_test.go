// ---- NonceLRU cleanup goroutine: ticker.C eviction branch ------------------
//
// The cleanup() goroutine uses a ticker whose minimum interval is 10 s
// (clamped by the production code). This test waits up to 12 s for at least
// one tick to fire, which evicts an already-expired entry. The test is NOT
// marked t.Parallel() so it does not inflate wall-clock time for the parallel
// batch, and it is skipped in short mode (-test.short).
