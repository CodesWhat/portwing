Portwing is a remote Docker access agent, not a fleet-management UI. The useful
comparison is therefore two-layered:

1. compare Portwing with the agent installed on each Docker host; and
2. compare Drydock with the controller features that sit above those agents.

Treating every controller feature as a Portwing requirement would expand the
agent's privilege and attack surface without improving its core job.

## Products reviewed

### Direct agent peers

| Product | Release reviewed | Why it is in scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Portainer Agent / Edge Agent | Portainer [2.39.5](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/releases/tag/2.39.5) | Mature standard and outbound-edge agents with Docker API proxying, Swarm support, async edge operation, and fleet lifecycle features. |
| Komodo Periphery | [v2.3.2](https://github.com/moghtech/komodo/releases/tag/v2.3.2) | Remote host agent for containers, Compose, builds, host terminals, automation, and Swarm. Komodo v2 added outbound Periphery and public-key authentication. |
| Arcane Agent | [v2.10.1](https://github.com/getarcaneapp/arcane/releases/tag/v2.10.1) | Direct and outbound-edge Docker agent with continuous or polling transport, optional mTLS, Swarm, and a broad controller surface. v2.10.0 moved its signing surfaces, including edge mTLS, to ML-DSA-87. |
| Hawser | [v0.2.46](https://github.com/Finsys/hawser/releases/tag/v0.2.46) | The closest scope match: a small Go Docker API proxy for Dockhand with standard and outbound WebSocket modes. |

### Adjacent products and baselines

| Product/category | Classification |
| --- | --- |
| Docker SSH or TLS | The native remote-access baseline. Docker warns that an exposed daemon can grant host-level control and documents SSH or TLS protection. |
| Tecnativa, LinuxServer, and Wollomatic socket proxies | Local Docker-socket authorization layers. Sockguard competes here; these are complementary to a remote agent. |
| Distr Docker Agent | A BYOC/on-prem application delivery agent with self-updates, Compose/Swarm reconciliation, logs, and metrics. It is adjacent because it deploys applications rather than exposing a general Docker control surface. |
| Docker Surgeon | A small inbound REST agent for monitoring and restarting unhealthy containers. It is narrower than Portwing but belongs on the watch list. |
| Beszel and Diun | Monitoring/notification agents, not remote Docker control agents. |
| Watchtower | Local container updater, not a remote access agent; its upstream repository is archived. |

## Agent capability matrix

“Not documented” means the reviewed primary documentation did not establish
the capability. It is intentionally different from a definitive “no.”

| Capability | Portwing v0.9.11 | Portainer Agent | Komodo Periphery | Arcane Agent | Hawser |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Inbound mode | HTTP/S with Docker API proxy and higher-level endpoints | Classic Agent | Core-to-Periphery supported | Direct mode on agent port | HTTP/S Docker API proxy |
| Outbound / NAT mode | Persistent WebSocket to Drydock; no inbound port | Edge Agent reverse tunnel | Bidirectional WebSocket; Periphery can dial Core | Edge mode over gRPC or WebSocket | Persistent WebSocket to Dockhand |
| Polling / intermittently connected mode | No | Async Edge | Not documented | Yes (`EDGE_TRANSPORT=poll`) | No |
| Transparent Docker API | Yes | Yes | No; controller-specific command/resource API | No; controller-specific API | Yes |
| Container lifecycle, logs, exec | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Compose lifecycle | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Image builds through the hardened socket profile | Docker build streaming is proxied; the base and compose Sockguard presets deny `/build`, `/session`, and `/grpc`, but `portwing-with-build.yaml` and `portwing-with-mediated-build.yaml` allow classic and BuildKit builds respectively | Yes | Yes | Yes | Full Docker proxy; Dockhand documents builds |
| General host shell or file browser | No; container exec only | Agent exposes file-browse APIs | Host shell supported | Volume/project file operations | No general host shell documented |
| Swarm orchestration | No; explicit non-goal | Yes | Yes | Yes | Not documented |
| Standard-mode agent auth | Ed25519 signature over method, request target, body hash, timestamp, and nonce; token fallback | Claim key exchange; optional shared `AGENT_SECRET` | Public-key authenticated channel | Agent token | Bearer token |
| Edge agent auth | Ed25519-signed hello over TLS; classical signatures, no post-quantum option | Edge key, revolving password, optional Business mTLS | Public-key handshake with per-server keys | Agent token; optional or required automatically enrolled mTLS. mTLS is off unless `EDGE_MTLS_MODE` is set, and from v2.10.0 a freshly generated edge CA and the certificates it issues use ML-DSA-87 (FIPS 204 post-quantum); an existing ECDSA P-384 CA keeps issuing P-384 client certificates | Token over WSS |
| Explicit per-request replay defense | Yes for signed HTTP requests | Not documented | Channel handshake; no per-request scheme documented | TLS/channel authentication; no per-request scheme documented | Not documented |
| Credential rotation | Multiple keys; file update plus SIGHUP in standard mode. Edge mode cannot overlap keys because Drydock binds one agent name to one key ID, so rotation is revoke-then-reconnect with a brief disconnect; see `docs/design/mldsa-edge-auth.md` section 8. Manual operational flow | Revolving Edge password; Edge key lifecycle | Automatic Periphery key rotation | Automatic certificate renewal; environment token can be regenerated | Manual token replacement |
| Docker socket least privilege | Recommended Sockguard path-and-method allowlist; Portwing need not mount the raw socket | Documented deployment mounts the socket and host paths directly | Documented deployment mounts the socket directly | Optional Tecnativa category-level socket proxy; direct socket is the default simple path | Documented deployment mounts the socket directly |
| Agent-level audit trail | Structured API, authentication, enrollment, Compose, and exec records; cursor-based export | Controller activity logs are a Business feature | Controller stores a full audit trail | Controller activities and security audit events | Debug request logs; no structured audit export documented |
| Agent Prometheus endpoint | Yes | No agent scrape endpoint documented | Host metrics and alerts, but no agent scrape endpoint documented | Metrics in the controller; no agent scrape endpoint documented | Host metrics forwarded to Dockhand; no scrape endpoint documented |
| Read-only MCP server | Yes | Not documented | Not documented | Not documented | Not documented |
| Verifiable release artifacts | Cosign signatures, CycloneDX SBOM, and SLSA Build L2 provenance | Not evaluated | Not evaluated | Cosign-verifiable artifacts and images | Checksummed releases; no equivalent set documented |
| Controller-managed agent upgrades | Not shipped; immutable packages/images are upgraded by the operator | Yes, including Edge fleet policies | Auto-update facilities exist; an agent rollout contract was not established in this review | Manager can upgrade agents | Manual deployment update |

## What the review changes

The market has closed several gaps that older Portwing material described as
advantages:

- Komodo v2.0.0 shipped outbound Periphery connections and public-key
  authentication together: Core and Periphery now authenticate with
  automatically generated public/private key pairs, exchanged over a
  Noise-protocol handshake, with automatic key rotation. That fully replaced
  the old passkey-only auth model, not supplemented it.
- Arcane now supports direct and outbound agents, polling transport, automated
  mTLS enrollment and renewal, optional Docker socket proxying, signed release
  artifacts, and controller-driven upgrades.
- Arcane v2.10.0 moved session tokens, OIDC verification, passkeys, and edge
  mTLS to ML-DSA-87, the FIPS 204 post-quantum lattice signature scheme. Only
  edge mTLS is in this matrix's scope; release-artifact signing is a separate
  Cosign chain and did not change. Edge mTLS is still opt-in, the agent token
  still bootstraps the first enrollment, and an existing ECDSA P-384 CA keeps
  issuing P-384 client certificates, so this is a key-type change inside an
  optional feature rather than a new authentication mode. It is still a real
  lead, because Portwing has no post-quantum signing option on any surface.
  Ed25519 is not weaker than ML-DSA-87 against any attacker that exists
  today, and nothing here makes the signed hello unsafe. The difference is
  the horizon: an agent identity key is long-lived and its public half is
  held by the controller, so a cryptographically relevant quantum computer
  arriving inside that key's service life would let an attacker recover the
  private key and impersonate the agent. That is the case ML-DSA-87 answers
  and Ed25519 does not, which is why this row reads as a difference rather
  than a tie. The evaluation is in
  [`docs/design/mldsa-edge-auth.md`](docs/design/mldsa-edge-auth.md), which
  defers adoption, sketches a hybrid Ed25519 + ML-DSA-87 hello (both keys on one
  identity record, its own guard on the new signature field, and a per-identity
  flag that makes it mandatory) as controller-first and not backward compatible,
  rejects a 6 KB per-request signature, and names key rotation as the mitigation
  that fits the threat today.
- Hawser now matches Portwing's broad topology: lightweight Go binary,
  transparent Docker API, Compose, host metrics, standard mode, and outbound
  edge mode.

Portwing's defensible agent-level advantages are narrower and more concrete:

- replay-resistant Ed25519 signatures on individual standard-mode requests;
- a signed edge hello without a reusable bearer credential on the agent;
- a documented Sockguard path-and-method policy boundary;
- structured audit records generated at the Docker mediation point;
- a native Prometheus endpoint and read-only MCP surface; and
- a deliberately small agent with a three-direct-dependency policy.

## Known caveats in reviewed outbound/edge implementations

Every direct peer reviewed here now supports both inbound and outbound
connection modes. That is required parity, not a unique claim, and it
describes direction support only, not equal robustness. Two of the reviewed
outbound implementations have maintainer-confirmed gaps worth tracking:

- **Hawser's edge mode is not fully outbound-only.** It starts an HTTP server
  on port 2376 (serving `/_hawser/health` and `/_hawser/info`) bound to all
  interfaces unless the operator sets `BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1`
  (maintainer-confirmed: <https://github.com/Finsys/hawser/issues/71>).
  Portwing's edge mode also runs a local health listener, but it defaults to
  loopback (`bindAddressDefault = "127.0.0.1"` in `internal/config/config.go`)
  and the config loader refuses a non-loopback bind unless the operator sets
  `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_REMOTE=true`.
- **Komodo's outbound leg has two open gaps.** It ignores
  `https_proxy`/`HTTPS_PROXY` for the outbound connection
  (open since 2026-06-09: <https://github.com/moghtech/komodo/issues/1473>),
  and a hardcoded 2-second handshake timeout can stall reconnection
  indefinitely (open since 2026-07-08:
  <https://github.com/moghtech/komodo/issues/1518>).

## Decisions

### Required before v1.0

1. **Release-artifact integration test.** Validate the tagged Portwing,
   Drydock, and Sockguard artifacts together in standard and edge modes. Cover
   lifecycle, events, snapshots, logs, exec, reconnects, backpressure, and the
   expected allow/deny behavior of every published Sockguard preset.
2. **Credential lifecycle exercise.** Test enrollment, overlapping-key
   rotation, revocation, SIGHUP reload, clock-skew failure, and recovery with a
   real Drydock controller. The cryptography is implemented; the fleet
   operation must be proved and documented.
3. **Published capability boundary.** Keep `COMPATIBILITY.md`, the OpenAPI
   contract, Sockguard presets, and this matrix aligned. Classic `POST /build`
   stays denied in the base and compose presets; `portwing-with-build.yaml`
   allows it for a `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0` client, and
   `portwing-with-mediated-build.yaml` allows a stock `docker compose build`
   by having Sockguard terminate and inspect the BuildKit `/session` and
   `/grpc` traffic (sockguard v1.7.0+, sockguard issue #185) instead of
   hijacking the streams.
4. **Competitive-claim verification.** Comparison pages must state the
   reviewed product version/date and link to this evidence. Unknown behavior
   is “not documented,” not “no.”

The review did not identify a missing container lifecycle, streaming, Compose,
observability, or authentication primitive that requires new Portwing code for
v1.0.

### Candidate work after v1.0 or when demand is proven

| Candidate | Owner | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Controller-managed Portwing upgrade/rollback waves | Drydock + Portwing packaging | Design after the tagged three-product acceptance pass. Do not add an unaudited self-update endpoint to the agent. |
| Optional mTLS client authentication | Portwing | Defense in depth for certificate-mandated environments; Ed25519 plus TLS remains the supported baseline. |
| Polling/intermittent edge transport | Drydock + Portwing | Defer until an offline/low-bandwidth deployment requires it; the current persistent tunnel is the Drydock contract. |
| Automated controller-assisted key rotation | Drydock + Portwing | Preserve operator-controlled trust roots; design a two-key overlap flow rather than letting a controller silently replace its only trust anchor. |
| Broader platform support such as Podman or Windows agents | Portwing | Demand-driven; do not dilute Docker/Linux reliability before v1.0. |

### Explicit non-goals for the Portwing agent

- Host shell execution, arbitrary host-file browsing, and volume backup APIs.
- Swarm or Kubernetes orchestration.
- A bundled UI, RBAC database, GitOps engine, scheduler, vulnerability scanner,
  notification system, or secrets vault.
- Automatic workload updates or autonomous mutation of the agent.

Those are legitimate product capabilities, but they belong in Drydock or a
specialized adjacent service. Portwing should expose only the bounded,
observable primitives the controller needs.

## Feature ownership
