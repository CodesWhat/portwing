# ML-DSA for the Edge Hello and Request Signatures — Design

**Status:** Deferred (decision recorded; no code change)  
**Author:** PW-5.13a evaluation  
**Branch:** `docs/pqc-edge-auth-design`  
**Date:** 2026-09-03  
**Related:** `docs/design/ed25519-auth.md`, `docs/security-model.md`, `COMPETITIVE-LANDSCAPE.md`

**Revised twice on 2026-09-03 after review. The decision is unchanged.**
Corrections are marked in place rather than quietly rewritten, because most were
overclaims and the record of what was wrong is the useful part.

First round: the scope of what a hybrid hello buys (§4.2), the identity binding
a hybrid composition requires (§5.2, §6.3), the impossibility of negotiating on
the welcome frame (§6.1), Go's post-quantum certificate support having already
landed (§7.3), the edge-mode rotation sequence (§8.2), and three measurement
errors (§3.1, §3.2, §3.4).

Second round, all of it compatibility: section 6 is now a **sketch with open
questions** (§6.6) rather than a settled design, because a compatibility claim
is what failed review twice. The pair-derived identity ID from the first
revision is withdrawn — it broke every un-upgraded controller and bought nothing,
since the binding lives in the record (§6.3). The rollout is controller-first
and **not** backward compatible (§6.5). Private key storage for a second key is
unresolved and the "`PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` does not grow" claim was wrong (§6.7,
§3.1). Channel binding only works where Drydock terminates TLS, and the relay
attack stays open behind a terminating proxy (§4.2). The certificate trigger is
about issuance and ecosystem compatibility, not runtime support (§7.3).

Third round, consistency: 6.3's binding argument is now explicitly a read-path
argument that depends on hybrid enrolment staying authorization gated, with proof
of possession recorded as an open question (§6.3, §6.5, §6.6); §8.2 no longer
claims hybrid enrolment inherits the rotation disconnect, which contradicted 6.3
once the pair-derived ID was withdrawn.

**Standing instruction for the next reader:** every compatibility statement here
needs re-checking against Drydock at implementation time. Three drafts have now
asserted one that the code did not support.

## 1. Decision

**Defer adopting ML-DSA on both signed surfaces. Do not adopt pure ML-DSA-87
anywhere.** The two surfaces get different answers when the trigger fires, and
the difference is the whole point of this note:

- **Edge hello (once per connection):** adopt **hybrid Ed25519 + ML-DSA-87**
  when Drydock ships a verifier. The cost is a 4,627-byte signature and about
  360 microseconds, once, on a connection that lives for hours. What that buys
  is precisely **agent-to-controller authentication of the hello**, and nothing
  more. It is not a post-quantum edge session; section 4.2 sets out what else
  would be required and why this note does not claim it.
- **Standard-mode per-request signature:** **do not adopt, in any form.** It
  would add about 6,084 bytes to every request forever, roughly 24 times the
  current signed-request header block, to defend a threat that is a key
  lifetime problem rather than a per-message one. If standard mode ever needs a
  post-quantum identity, the answer is a post-quantum authenticated session or
  mTLS layer that mints a short-lived credential, not a 6 KB header on every
  Docker API call.
- **Today, with no wire change:** publish a key rotation cadence. The real
  exposure is bounded by how long an agent identity key stays in service, and
  rotation is the mitigation that actually matches that shape. Section 8.

This is a defer with the target design already settled, so the work is a
scheduled change rather than a fresh evaluation. Triggers are in section 7.

---

## 2. What is actually signed today

Two messages carry a signature, and both cross the Portwing/Drydock boundary in
opposite directions. Neither can be changed by one repo alone.

### 2.1 Edge hello — Portwing signs, Drydock verifies

`internal/edge/client.go:645-676` (`signHello`) signs a fixed canonical string
once per WebSocket connection:

```text
GET\n/api/portwing/ws\n<sha256 of empty string>\n<unix seconds>\n<32-hex nonce>
```

That is 129 bytes. Method, path, and body hash are constants; only the
timestamp and nonce vary. The signature goes into `HelloMessage.Signature` as
base64url (`internal/protocol/messages.go:58-77`), and signing failure is fatal
rather than a fallback to token auth (`internal/edge/client.go:602-608`).

**Nothing after the hello is signed.** The WebSocket carries requests,
responses, streams, and exec traffic with no per-message signature, so the
hello is the only application-layer authentication in edge mode and WSS carries
everything that follows. This is why the hello is the cheap surface to upgrade:
one signature, once per connection, rather than one per message.

Two limits on what that signature proves, both load-bearing for section 4.2.
The hello authenticates the **agent to the controller only**; nothing
authenticates the controller back to the agent except the TLS server
certificate, which `internal/config/config.go:147-149` states outright. And the
hello has **no channel binding**: the canonical string covers a fixed method,
path, and empty-body hash plus a timestamp and nonce, with nothing tying it to
the TLS connection it travels over.

Drydock verifies it in `app/api/portwing-ws.ts`, reconstructing the identical
five-field canonical string and calling `verify(null, canonical, pubKey,
sigBuf)`. The algorithm is chosen entirely by the key, and the key is forced to
Ed25519 by a hardcoded SPKI prefix constant `302a300506032b6570032100`.

### 2.2 Standard-mode request signature — Drydock signs, Portwing verifies

`internal/auth/verify.go` (`VerifyRequest`) verifies a signature over
`METHOD\nREQUEST-TARGET\nbody-sha256-hex\nunix-timestamp\nnonce` on **every**
HTTP request, after a timestamp skew check and a nonce LRU replay check. Five
headers carry it: `X-Portwing-Key-ID`, `X-Portwing-Timestamp`,
`X-Portwing-Nonce`, `X-Portwing-Signature`, and `X-Portwing-Signature-Version`.

Standard mode has no session. Each request is independently authenticated, so
there is no handshake to upgrade and no way to amortise a signature across
requests. That is the structural reason the two surfaces price so differently.

### 2.3 Key format and identity

Both sides use the same `authorized_keys` line shape,
`ed25519 <standard-base64 pubkey> [comment]`, and both hard-reject anything
else. Portwing's parser rejects a first field that is not the literal
`ed25519` and a decoded key that is not exactly 32 bytes
(`internal/auth/keys.go:135-165`). Drydock rejects the same two things, with
the 32-byte check appearing in three separate places.

The key ID is `hex(SHA-256(raw public key)[:8])`, 16 hex characters
(`internal/auth/keygen.go:90-93`), and Drydock derives it identically. It
identifies **a key**, not an agent identity. That is fine while an identity is
exactly one key, and it is the root of the binding problem in section 5.2 the
moment an identity is two keys. Section 6.3 resolves it, and deliberately does
so without changing the derivation.

Portwing reloads `authorized_keys` on SIGHUP (`internal/server/http.go:245-266`)
and the registry holds many keys at once, so **standard mode** supports overlap
rotation today with no code change.

**Edge mode does not**, and an earlier draft of this note said it did. Drydock
binds an agent name to a single key ID in a `Map<string, {keyId}>`
(`app/api/portwing-ws.ts:151`) and rejects a hello whose `agentName` is already
bound to a different `pubKeyId` with `agent-name-claimed`
(`app/api/portwing-ws.ts:763-781`). The binding is durable across controller
restarts, is **not** released on disconnect, and is cleared only by revoking the
owning key or by idle eviction after 24 hours under cap pressure. A second live
session under one name is separately refused as `agent-already-connected`. The
consequence for rotation is in section 8.2, and it is not the sequence this note
originally gave.

## 3. Measured numbers

Measured on this machine with a throwaway benchmark, not committed. Reproduce
with the recipe in section 9.

- **Machine:** Apple M4 Pro, 14 cores, `darwin/arm64`.
- **Toolchain:** `go1.27.1`, `crypto/mldsa` and `crypto/ed25519` from the
  standard library.
- **Method:** `go test -bench . -benchtime 2s -count 5`, median of 5 reported.
- **Message:** the real 129-byte edge-hello canonical string from section 2.1.

Note these are **not** comparable to `BENCHMARKS.md`, which was measured on a
GitHub-hosted Xeon under `go1.26.6`. They are internally consistent with each
other, which is what the ratios below depend on.

### 3.1 Sizes

| Scheme | Public key | Signature | Signature as base64url | Public key as base64 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ed25519 | 32 B | 64 B | 86 chars | 44 chars |
| ML-DSA-65 | 1,952 B | 3,309 B | 4,412 chars | 2,604 chars |
| ML-DSA-87 | 2,592 B | 4,627 B | 6,170 chars | 3,456 chars |

ML-DSA-87 is 72 times Ed25519's signature and 81 times its public key.

ML-DSA-65's signature is genuinely smaller, by 28.5 percent (1,318 bytes), and
its public key by 24.7 percent. That is a real saving and it is worth not
dismissing. It just does not change either decision, because neither decision
turns on a number in that range. On the per-request surface, 3,309 bytes is
still 51 times Ed25519 and still lands the header block in the same
multiple-kilobyte class, with the same proxy-limit and per-request-cost problems
intact; 28.5 percent off a cost that was rejected as an order-of-magnitude
mistake does not rescue it. On the hello, where the cost is already acceptable,
saving 1,318 bytes once per connection buys nothing worth a lower security
category. So the saving is real and the conclusion is unchanged: if the cost is
acceptable at all, take the higher category.

A Go `mldsa.PrivateKey` serialises as a **32-byte seed**, the same size as an
Ed25519 seed, so an ML-DSA key is not individually larger at rest than the key
it would sit beside.

That is as far as the point goes, and an earlier draft took it further than the
evidence allows by concluding that `PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` does not grow. It does. A
hybrid identity holds **two** independent private keys, so the stored material
roughly doubles, and today's loader reads exactly one PEM block and hard-fails
anything that is not an Ed25519 PKCS#8 key (`internal/auth/keygen.go:31-47`).
Storage for the second key is an open question, not a solved one; see 6.7.

### 3.2 Timing

| Operation | Ed25519 | ML-DSA-65 | ML-DSA-87 | Hybrid (Ed + 87) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sign | 13.4 us | 317.8 us | 364.5 us | 408.1 us |
| Verify | 27.0 us | 81.2 us | 140.4 us | 165.0 us |
| Keygen | 13.2 us | not measured | 210.3 us | not measured |

ML-DSA-87 verify is 5.2 times Ed25519 verify; hybrid verify is 6.1 times. Sign
is worse in ratio (27 and 30 times) but sign happens on the client, once per
connection for the hello.

Allocation behaviour is good: ML-DSA-87 verify is 0 B/op and 0 allocs/op, the
same as Ed25519 verify. Sign is 4,864 B/op in a single allocation.

**CPU is not the blocker on the agent.** Even at 140 us, a single core does
about 7,100 ML-DSA-87 verifies per second, and Portwing is a single-agent
sidecar, not a fleet-wide verification service. `BENCHMARKS.md` publishes no
request rate at all and explicitly disclaims throughput measurement, so there is
no fleet number to multiply against.

That claim needs qualifying on the other side, and an earlier draft did not
qualify it. **Drydock signs centrally for the whole fleet**, and signing is the
expensive direction: 364.5 us against Ed25519's 13.4 us, a factor of 27, on a
single-threaded Node event loop. A controller driving N agents pays that on every
standard-mode request it issues, so the per-request option's CPU cost lands
almost entirely on the controller rather than on the agent measured here. That
does not change the verdict, because the byte cost already rejects the
per-request option on its own, but "CPU is affordable" is an agent-side statement
and should not be read as a fleet-side one. On the hello, where signing is once
per connection, it is a non-issue in both directions.

Bytes are the problem, not cycles.

Worth stating plainly because it is easy to misread: the published
`AuthMiddleware/authorized_raw` figure of 433.4 ns in `BENCHMARKS.md` is the
**raw-token** path. `internal/server/middleware_bench_test.go:59` passes an empty
`Ed25519Config{}`, so no signature is verified in that benchmark. Signature
verification therefore dominates the authenticated request path by about two
orders of magnitude, and ML-DSA-87 would multiply that already-dominant term by
5.2. Read that as a magnitude and not a ratio: the 433.4 ns figure was measured
on a different machine and toolchain from the numbers above, which is exactly
the comparison this section warned against making precisely.

### 3.3 Per-request byte cost, standard mode

Header block for the five signature headers, name plus `": "` plus value plus
CRLF:

| Configuration | Signature header block | Delta per request |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ed25519 today | 266 B | baseline |
| Pure ML-DSA-87 | 6,350 B | +6,084 B |
| Hybrid Ed25519 + ML-DSA-87 | 6,503 B | +6,237 B |

That is roughly 6.1 MB of pure signature overhead per 1,000 requests. A
6,170-character single header value also sits close to the 8 KB per-header-line
limit that a default nginx `large_client_header_buffers 4 8k` imposes. Portwing's
own Go server does not set `MaxHeaderBytes`, so it takes Go's 1 MB default and
would accept it, but any reverse proxy in front of an agent becomes a
deployment-specific compatibility question that does not exist today.

### 3.4 Once-per-connection byte cost, edge hello

The recommended shape adds a `signaturePq` field beside the existing
`signature` rather than replacing it, so the delta is **+6,187 bytes** of JSON
(the 6,170-character base64url value, its quotes, the `"signaturePq":` key, and
the separating comma), not the 6,084-byte replacement delta used for standard
mode in 3.3. An earlier draft quoted the replacement figure here, which
understated the added-field shape by about 100 bytes.

The governing limit is **Drydock's**, not Portwing's: the controller's
`WebSocketServer` is constructed with `maxPayload: MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES`, 16 MB
(`app/api/portwing-ws.ts:68, 458`). Portwing's own
`conn.SetReadLimit(maxReadSize)` at `internal/edge/client.go:386`, with the
constant at `:45`, caps frames the agent *receives*, so it does not govern a
hello the agent sends, and an earlier draft cited it as though it did. The two happen to be the same 16 MB, which is
why the error was invisible. A 6 KB hello against a 16 MB cap is not measurable
in practice either way.

A hybrid `authorized_keys` line grows from roughly 55 bytes to roughly 3,520.

This is the entire case for splitting the decision by surface.

### 3.5 Cross-implementation interoperability, verified

Go 1.27's `crypto/mldsa` and Node 24.20's `node:crypto` (OpenSSL 3.6.4) produce
**mutually verifiable** ML-DSA-87 signatures with an empty context. Both
directions were tested and both pass:

- Node verified a Go-produced signature over the hello canonical string.
- Go verified a Node-produced signature over the same string.

Node needs the raw 2,592-byte public key wrapped in SPKI DER, exactly as
Drydock already does for Ed25519. The prefix is a fixed 22 bytes:

```text
30820a32300b060960864801650304031303820a2100
```

Drydock runs `node:24-alpine` and requires `node >= 24.0.0`, so this is
available to it today. **Neither side needs a new dependency.** That removes
what would otherwise have been the strongest reason to defer, and it is why the
trigger in section 7 is cheap to hit rather than years away.

---

## 4. The threat, stated honestly

**Harvest-now-decrypt-later does not apply to signatures.** There is no
plaintext behind a signature to recover later. A captured hello or signed
request is already useless for replay: the timestamp window and the nonce LRU
reject it, on both surfaces, today.

The real exposure is narrower and worth naming precisely. An agent identity key
is long-lived, and its public half is deliberately distributed: it sits in
Drydock's key store and in `authorized_keys` files on both hosts. An attacker
who holds that public key and later obtains a cryptographically relevant quantum
computer, **while that same key is still in service**, can recover the private
key and impersonate the agent from then on. The exposure window is the key's
remaining service life intersected with CRQC availability. It is not the
lifetime of any captured traffic.

Two consequences follow, and they drive the decision.

First, **shortening the key's service life attacks the exposure directly**,
which is what makes rotation a real mitigation rather than a consolation prize.
Section 8.

Second, **the property has to attach to the identity, not to a message
subset**, and in standard mode each request is independently authenticated, so
every request would need the post-quantum signature for the property to hold.
There is no partial credit. Signing only some requests, or only the hello while
standard mode stays classical, protects nothing. This is precisely why the
per-request cost cannot be avoided by sampling or by upgrading one surface and
calling standard mode covered.

### 4.1 What is already post-quantum

Worth recording so the gap is not overstated. The agent's outbound edge dial
uses `&tls.Config{MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12}` with no `CurvePreferences`
override (`internal/edge/client.go:346-350`), so it takes Go's default key
exchange preferences. From Go 1.24 those include the `X25519MLKEM768` hybrid
post-quantum key exchange, and from Go 1.26 also `SecP256r1MLKEM768` and
`SecP384r1MLKEM1024`. Subject to the controller offering one of them, **the
harvest-now-decrypt-later-relevant defence is already on by default** and needs
no work here.

So the confidentiality of edge traffic against a **passive** future CRQC is
handled at the transport. What remains is authentication, which is the part that
was never an HNDL problem. That is the correct order of operations, and it is
the reason this item is a low-priority scheduled change rather than an urgent
gap.

### 4.2 What a hybrid hello does not buy

An earlier draft of this note claimed a hybrid hello would make the edge session
post-quantum authenticated. That is wrong and worth stating plainly, because it
is the kind of overclaim that stops further work from happening.

A hybrid hello defends exactly one thing: an attacker who recovers the agent's
identity private key from its public half cannot then impersonate that agent to
the controller. That is agent-to-controller authentication of a single message.

It does **not** defend the session against an active attacker, for two reasons
from section 2.1. Controller authentication rests entirely on the TLS server
certificate, whose signature is classical X.509. An attacker who can forge that
certificate, which is the same CRQC capability, becomes a machine-in-the-middle:
the agent completes a TLS handshake with the attacker, and the hybrid PQ key
exchange from section 4.1 protects that connection's confidentiality against a
passive observer while doing nothing about the endpoint being wrong. Second,
because the hello carries no channel binding, the attacker can relay the agent's
perfectly valid hello, hybrid signature and all, onto its own connection to the
real controller, and then drive an unsigned session against dockerd. Upgrading
the hello's signature algorithm does not touch either problem.

Mutual post-quantum authentication of the edge session would additionally need:

1. **Post-quantum controller authentication.** A post-quantum or hybrid
   certificate chain for the controller, so the agent's peer verification does
   not rest on a classical signature. Section 7 trigger 3 covers the toolchain
   side of this, which is further along than expected.
2. **Channel binding, where the deployment allows it.** The hello canonical
   string extended to cover an RFC 9266 `tls-exporter` value, so a relayed hello
   is invalid on any channel but the one it was signed for. Both ends must pin
   the same exporter label, context, and output length, and TLS 1.3 is a
   minimum: the RFC 9266 construction is not defined for TLS 1.2, which
   Portwing's edge dial currently still permits
   (`internal/edge/client.go:347`).

   **This only works when Drydock terminates TLS itself, and it often does
   not.** Drydock's server TLS is off by default (`tls.enabled` defaults to
   `false`, `app/configuration/index.ts:508`), and the common deployment puts it
   behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy. In that topology the controller
   process never sees the TLS connection the agent signed against, so it cannot
   derive the exporter value, and a proxy-forwarded binding is worthless because
   the proxy is exactly the position the attacker occupies in this scenario.
   There is no fallback that preserves the property: for proxied deployments
   **the relay attack in this section stays open**, and the honest answer is to
   say so rather than to ship a header that looks like a binding. Closing it
   there would need the agent to authenticate the proxy's certificate as the
   controller identity, which is a different design.
3. **Post-quantum session integrity**, or an explicit decision that TLS record
   integrity is sufficient once the endpoints are authenticated.

None of that is in scope here, and item 2 is arguably the highest-value item in
this whole note. It is filed as its own roadmap concern rather than folded into
the ML-DSA decision, because it is not a post-quantum problem.

---

## 5. Options compared

### 5.1 Pure ML-DSA-87

**Rejected.**

It is an immediate hard break with every deployed Drydock, on both surfaces at
once. Drydock rejects a hello signature longer than 200 characters before it
ever reaches verification, with a comment noting Ed25519 base64url signatures
are exactly 86 characters; an ML-DSA-87 signature is 6,170. The `authorized_keys`
parsers on both sides reject a non-`ed25519` algorithm field and a public key
that is not exactly 32 bytes. Drydock's agent config validates `authmode`
against a two-value allowlist.

Beyond compatibility, it removes a mature primitive in exchange for one that
was standardised in August 2024, on a surface where the classical primitive is
not weak against any attacker that exists. A lattice break would be total
against a pure deployment. The comparison to Arcane does not carry: Arcane's
ML-DSA-87 change is inside an opt-in mTLS feature that is off unless
`EDGE_MTLS_MODE` is set, so matching it would not mean matching a default.

### 5.2 Hybrid Ed25519 + ML-DSA-87

**Right shape, wrong time to ship.**

An AND-composition, verifying both signatures and failing closed if either
fails, is at least as strong as the stronger of the two **provided both keys
are bound to a single identity**. That proviso is the whole design, not a
footnote, and an earlier draft of this note dropped it while proposing two
independently registered key IDs joined by a shared comment. That shape is
broken: an attacker holding a victim's CRQC-recovered Ed25519 key and their own
legitimately enrolled ML-DSA key presents one of each, both verify against their
respective registered keys, and the AND passes. The composition is then only as
strong as its weakest key, which is the opposite of the intended property.
Section 6.3 fixes this by storing both public keys on **one identity record**,
so the ML-DSA key is reachable only through the record the Ed25519 key ID
resolves to, and keys from two records cannot be combined. The fix is the shared
record, not a change to how key IDs are derived; an intermediate draft also
re-derived the ID over both keys, which bought no extra security and broke every
un-upgraded controller (6.3). With the record binding in place the composition
survives both a CRQC and a lattice break, which is the correct posture for a
primitive this young.

It is also the only shape that leaves the classical path intact while a fleet
migrates, since the existing 86-character `signature` field keeps its meaning
and an old controller ignores the new one. **That is not the same as being
backward compatible, and two earlier drafts of this note confused the two.**
The key store and the `authorized_keys` format both have to change first;
section 6.5 sets out the controller-first order and why the rollout breaks
without it.

The temptation is to ship the agent half now so the fleet already emits the
second signature when Drydock catches up. **That is a trap, for two reasons.**
An emitted but unverified signature provides exactly zero security while costing
bytes and CPU, and it would read in a changelog as post-quantum protection that
does not exist. More seriously, it would commit Portwing to a wire shape before
the counterparty has designed theirs, and the counterparty's design is the one
that has to carry the identity record, the separate length guard, and the
per-identity policy flag that the property actually depends on. Two
independently invented "hybrid" formats is a worse outcome than waiting.

### 5.3 Defer

**Chosen.** With the target shape sketched in section 6, its open questions
recorded in 6.6, and triggers in
section 7, so this is a scheduled change rather than an open question.

---

## 6. Target sketch, for when the trigger fires

**This is a sketch, not a settled design.** It records the shape the evaluation
points at so the analysis is not repeated, and it is written down mainly so the
open questions in 6.6 are visible. Two earlier drafts of this section each
claimed backward compatibility that the Drydock code does not support, so treat
every compatibility statement below as needing to be re-checked against Drydock
at implementation time, and treat 6.5 as a hard constraint rather than a detail.

### 6.1 Edge hello: a second signature field, sent unconditionally

Add `signaturePq` to `HelloMessage` beside the existing `signature`, which keeps
its meaning and its 86-character size. The agent sends both whenever it holds a
hybrid identity and does **not** try to negotiate first.

Negotiation is not available: `internal/edge/client.go:393` sends the hello and
only then waits for the welcome at `:398`, so nothing about the controller is
known when the hello is built. An earlier draft gated the post-quantum fields on
a controller capability in the welcome frame, which cannot work.

An old controller ignores the extra field. That much is verified rather than
assumed: Drydock parses the hello with a bare `JSON.parse` and per-field
`typeof` checks (`JSON.parse` at `app/api/portwing-ws.ts:547`, an unchecked cast
to `HelloMessage` at `:565`, and the per-field checks in the auth-mode detector
at `:635-639`), with no schema validator, no `strict`, and no unknown-key
rejection in that path. Its auth-mode detector
inspects only the four classic fields. **That is the limit of what old
controllers tolerate, and it is not enough on its own** — see 6.5.

Implementer's gotcha: the 200-character guard at `app/api/portwing-ws.ts:671`
is specific to `hello.signature`. `signaturePq` needs its own guard sized for a
6,170-character value, or it is an unbounded allocation from attacker-controlled
input. It must be a separate guard; raising the existing one would weaken the
check on the classical field.

### 6.2 Verification is fail-closed AND, and downgrade protection is policy

Both signatures must verify. One valid signature beside one invalid signature is
a rejection, never a pass.

Where downgrade safety comes from matters more than the AND. Because the hello
is the first frame and old controllers silently ignore the post-quantum fields,
**the wire cannot protect against downgrade at all.** An attacker holding a
CRQC-recovered Ed25519 key simply omits `signaturePq`. The only thing that stops
that is the controller refusing a classical-only hello for an identity its own
records mark as hybrid. That is a per-identity policy flag in Drydock's key
store, and it is the single most important part of this sketch to get right.

### 6.3 The binding lives in the record, and the key ID does not change

The security requirement from section 5.2 is that both public keys belong to one
identity, so an attacker cannot pair a victim's Ed25519 key with their own
ML-DSA key. **That requirement is satisfied by one record carrying both public
keys.** It does not require changing how the key ID is derived.

An earlier draft additionally derived a new pair-based ID over both keys. That
was unnecessary and actively harmful: Drydock derives key IDs from the raw
32-byte Ed25519 public key alone (`app/store/agent-keys.ts:52`) and looks them up
by exact match (`app/api/portwing-ws.ts:685`), so a pair-derived ID is simply
unknown to every controller that has not been upgraded, and a rolling upgrade or
a rollback fails with `unknown-key`, which Portwing treats as terminal.

So `pubKeyId` keeps its current derivation and its current value. Lookup finds
the identity record; if that record is hybrid, both keys in it are used. The
attack in 5.2 is closed **on the read path**, because the ML-DSA key is reachable
only through the record the Ed25519 key ID resolves to, and never independently.

That is only half the argument, and the other half is a write-path assumption
this sketch inherits rather than establishes. One-record lookup closes the attack
only while attaching an ML-DSA key to an existing record stays authorization
gated. Today the key-registration surface sits behind `requireAuthentication` and
`requireSameOriginForMutations` (`app/api/api.ts:128-129`), and `addKey` refuses
to overwrite a key that is still active (`app/store/agent-keys.ts:87-89`). But
`POST /keys` (`app/api/portwing.ts:34`) takes a bare public key and a label with
**no proof of possession**: the caller never demonstrates it holds the matching
private key. For a single Ed25519 key that is tolerable, because an authenticated
operator registering a key they do not control only locks themselves out. For a
hybrid record it is sharper: anyone who reaches that endpoint could attach an
ML-DSA key they own to an identity they do not, which reconstructs exactly the
mix-and-match failure from 5.2 through the front door. So the read-path binding
in this section is necessary and not sufficient; see 6.5 step 2 and the open
question in 6.6.

### 6.4 `authorized_keys` gains a hybrid line type

One line carries both public keys, so the file cannot express the unsafe
two-record shape:

```text
hybrid-ed25519-mldsa87 <base64 ed25519 pub> <base64 mldsa87 pub> [comment]
```

Both parsers keep the existing 32-byte check for the first key and add a
2,592-byte check for the second.

### 6.5 Migration is controller-first, and this is not backward compatible

Drydock's `authorized_keys` importer skips any line whose first field is not
literally `ed25519` (`app/store/agent-keys.ts:185`), and Portwing's parser does
the same (`internal/auth/keys.go:149`). A hybrid line is therefore invisible to
both until both are upgraded. **Do not describe this rollout as additive.** The
required order is:

1. Ship the controller: import hybrid lines, store both keys on one record,
   verify `signaturePq` when present, and add the per-identity hybrid policy
   flag from 6.2 defaulted off.
2. Enrol hybrid identities **through the authenticated key-registration path
   only**, never through an unauthenticated or trust-on-first-use route, and
   confirm the classical path still verifies. This is a hard requirement, not a
   preference: the whole security argument in 6.3 rests on an attacker being
   unable to attach their own ML-DSA key to someone else's identity record.
3. Ship agents that send `signaturePq`.
4. Only then turn the per-identity policy flag on, which is the step that
   actually buys the security property. Before this step the deployment has the
   costs and none of the benefit.

Rollback from step 3 to a pre-step-1 controller is safe only because
`pubKeyId` is unchanged (6.3). Rollback past step 4 silently drops the property.

### 6.6 Open design questions

These are unresolved. None is a blocker for the defer decision, and all of them
have to be answered before any of the above is implemented.

1. **Private key storage.** Unresolved; see 6.7.
2. **Does the per-identity policy flag belong in Drydock's key store or in an
   agent-side assertion?** This sketch puts it in Drydock, which is the only
   place it can be enforced, but that means the security property depends
   entirely on a repo Portwing does not own.
3. **What re-enrolment looks like for an existing agent.** Moving an identity
   from classical to hybrid changes the record, not the key ID, so it may avoid
   the section 8.2 disconnect. That is a hypothesis from reading the code, not
   something demonstrated, and it needs testing against a real controller.
4. **Whether hybrid enrolment needs proof of possession of the ML-DSA key.**
   `POST /keys` has none today (`app/api/portwing.ts:34`), and 6.3 explains why
   the gap matters more for a paired record than for a single key. The obvious
   fix is to require the enrolling caller to sign a server-issued challenge with
   the ML-DSA private key, which is cheap and would also cover the existing
   Ed25519 path. Not proposed here because it is Drydock's surface to design.
5. **Whether the ML-DSA signature should cover a context string.** Go's
   `mldsa.Options.Context` is free and would domain-separate hello signatures
   from any future use of the same key. Probably yes, but it has to be agreed
   on both sides before first deployment because it cannot change afterwards.
6. **Whether this should wait for channel binding** (section 4.2 item 2)
   instead, or ship alongside it, given that channel binding closes a live
   classical attack while this closes a future one.

### 6.7 Private key storage is unresolved

A hybrid identity needs **two independent private keys**, and today's storage
holds exactly one. `auth.ParsePrivateKeyPEM` decodes a single PEM block, requires
type `PRIVATE KEY`, and hard-fails anything that is not an Ed25519 PKCS#8 key
(`internal/auth/keygen.go:31-47`); `signHello` loads only that
(`internal/edge/client.go:648`).

This also corrects a claim in section 3.1. It is true that an ML-DSA-87 private
key serialises as a 32-byte seed, so it is not individually larger than an
Ed25519 seed. It is **not** true that `PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` does not grow: a hybrid
identity stores two keys instead of one, so the material roughly doubles.

Two options, neither chosen:

- **Two PEM blocks in one file.** Keeps one path and one permission check.
  Requires looping `pem.Decode` over the remaining bytes instead of reading the
  first block, and deciding what an unexpected extra block means.
- **A second env var**, `PRIVATE_KEY_PQ_FILE`. Simpler to parse, but doubles the
  mount and permission surface and makes a half-configured agent possible.

**Non-negotiable either way: the ML-DSA seed must be generated independently and
must never be derived from the Ed25519 seed.** Deriving one from the other would
make a CRQC recovery of the Ed25519 key yield the ML-DSA key too, which collapses
the hybrid to its weakest component and silently un-does the entire point of the
design.

### 6.8 Standard mode stays Ed25519

If a post-quantum identity is ever required there, do it as a post-quantum
authenticated session or mTLS handshake that issues a short-lived credential. A
credential with a service life measured in minutes is not a CRQC concern, which
is exactly the property section 4 establishes. Do not put ML-DSA in a
per-request header.

## 7. Revisit triggers

Any one of these reopens the decision. Each is checkable rather than a vibe.

1. **Drydock ships a hybrid verifier.** This is the primary trigger, and
   section 3.5 shows it needs no new dependency on either side. An earlier
   draft described it as adding a second algorithm to the existing single-key
   record and raising the 200-character guard; that describes a design section
   6 has since rejected. What to actually watch for, matching section 6:

   - `app/store/agent-keys.ts` stores **two public keys on one record**, with
     the ML-DSA key reachable only through the Ed25519-derived key ID, which
     `deriveKeyId` at `:52` keeps unchanged.
   - The importer at `app/store/agent-keys.ts:185` accepts a
     `hybrid-ed25519-mldsa87` line in addition to `ed25519`.
   - `app/api/portwing-ws.ts` verifies a `signaturePq` field under its **own**
     length guard, leaving the 200-character guard on `hello.signature` at
     `:671` untouched.
   - The key record carries a **per-identity hybrid-required flag**, which is
     the only thing that prevents the downgrade in section 6.2 and is therefore
     the part that actually matters.
2. **A user or compliance requirement lands** that names FIPS 204 on the agent
   identity. CNSA 2.0 is the date anchor worth watching even though it binds
   National Security Systems rather than a self-hosted Docker agent; its
   signature timelines run to 2030 and 2033. Note that CNSA 2.0 prefers pure
   ML-DSA while European guidance prefers hybrid, so if this trigger fires the
   pure-versus-hybrid call in section 5 has to be re-argued rather than
   inherited.
3. **The controller side gains post-quantum certificate support.** An earlier
   draft listed "Go's `crypto/tls` gains post-quantum signature algorithms" as
   a future trigger. **That is already satisfied and the trigger was wrong.**
   Go 1.27 registers `MLDSA44`, `MLDSA65`, and `MLDSA87` as full
   `x509.SignatureAlgorithm` values with no pre-hashing
   (`crypto/x509/x509.go:401-403`), parses ML-DSA public keys and PKCS#8
   private keys (`crypto/x509/parser.go:366-374`, `crypto/x509/pkcs8.go:83-111`),
   and carries the matching `MLDSA44`/`MLDSA65`/`MLDSA87` TLS signature schemes
   with `directSigning` (`crypto/tls/auth.go:145-146, 161-162`).

   **The runtime on the other end is not a blocker either**, which narrows this
   trigger further than the previous revision did. Drydock requires Node >= 24
   (`app/package.json:5-7`) and serves TLS through `https.createServer` when
   configured (`app/api/index.ts:260-270`), and section 3.5 measured that this Node
   and OpenSSL combination does ML-DSA-87 natively. A TLS 1.3 handshake with an
   ML-DSA-87 certificate is within reach of both stacks as they ship today.

   So the real trigger is **certificate issuance and ecosystem compatibility**,
   not runtime support: a CA path that will issue an ML-DSA leaf (public CAs
   will not, so this means an internal CA), plus every intermediary in the
   deployment tolerating a certificate chain roughly two orders of magnitude
   larger than an Ed25519 one, plus browsers and other clients that hit the same
   Drydock endpoint still working. That last constraint is the one most likely
   to bite, and it is a deployment question rather than a library question. When
   it is answerable, section 4.2 item 1 becomes available and section 6.8 should
   be revisited before anything else here.
4. **A credible CRQC estimate lands inside the rotation window** established in
   section 8. If keys rotate annually, an estimate that moves inside that
   horizon collapses the argument that rotation is sufficient.

---

## 8. What closes the gap today: rotation

The exposure in section 4 is bounded by an identity key's service life, and
bounding it costs no wire change, no new dependency, and no protocol
coordination. The **sequence differs by mode**, though, and getting that wrong
is how a rotation turns into an outage.

### 8.1 Standard mode: overlap rotation works

Portwing's registry holds many keys at once (`internal/auth/keys.go`) and
reloads `authorized_keys` on SIGHUP with no restart and no dropped connections
(`internal/server/http.go:245-266`). There is no name binding. So the ordinary
add-then-remove sequence works with no gap: append the new public key, SIGHUP,
cut the client over to the new `PRIVATE_KEY_FILE`, confirm requests are
authenticating under the new key ID, then remove the old line and SIGHUP again.
Both key IDs are logged on add and remove, so the cutover is observable.

### 8.2 Edge mode: revoke-then-reconnect, with a brief disconnect

An earlier draft of this note gave the 8.1 sequence for both modes. **That does
not work in edge mode**, and it would fail closed at the worst moment.

Drydock binds one agent name to one key ID (`app/api/portwing-ws.ts:151`). A
hello presenting a new `pubKeyId` under a name already bound to a different key
is rejected with `agent-name-claimed` before any welcome
(`app/api/portwing-ws.ts:763-781`), which Portwing correctly classifies as
terminal, so the agent stops rather than retrying
(`internal/edge/hello_reject.go`). The binding survives controller restarts and
is **not** released when the agent disconnects; only revoking the owning key
clears it, or idle eviction after 24 hours once the binding map is at its 10,000
cap. Two live sessions under one name are separately refused as
`agent-already-connected`.

So the working sequence, and the one to document:

1. Register the new public key in Drydock's key store. It coexists with the old
   one; the store is keyed per key with no name field, so this is safe.
2. Stage the new `PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` on the agent host without restarting it.
3. **Revoke the old key in Drydock.** This tears down the live session and
   releases the name binding in the same step.
4. Restart or let the agent reconnect. It presents the new key, the name is
   unbound, and it rebinds cleanly.

Step 3 to step 4 is a real gap, bounded by the agent's reconnect backoff. Plan
rotation as a short maintenance action rather than a zero-downtime one, and do
not reverse steps 3 and 4: revoking after the new key connects cannot work,
because the new key can never connect while the old binding stands.

**Named prerequisite for zero-downtime edge rotation.** Drydock would have to
let one agent name hold a set of authorized key IDs rather than a single one,
admitting any member and pruning on revocation. That is a Drydock change, not a
Portwing one, and it is worth raising with that repo independently of anything
post-quantum.

An earlier revision added that this also gates the hybrid migration, on the
grounds that moving an identity to a hybrid one is itself a key ID change. **That
was written before 6.3 dropped the pair-derived key ID and no longer holds.**
With `pubKeyId` keeping its current derivation, hybrid enrolment changes the
contents of the identity record and not its ID, so the name binding is never
challenged and the disconnect above should not apply. Marked "should" rather than
"does" deliberately: it follows from reading the code and has not been
demonstrated against a running controller, which is open question 3 in 6.6.

### 8.3 Guidance to add to `docs/security-model.md`

1. **Rotate each agent identity key at least annually**, and immediately on any
   suspected host compromise. The point is to keep every key's service life
   comfortably shorter than any credible CRQC horizon, so a key that is
   attackable in 2035 was retired years earlier.
2. **Use the sequence for the mode**, 8.1 for standard and 8.2 for edge. Rehearse
   the edge one before relying on it, since it involves a deliberate disconnect.
3. **Treat the public key as sensitive-adjacent.** It is not a secret, but it is
   the input to the attack in section 4, so keeping it off public surfaces
   shrinks the population of attackers who could ever use a CRQC against it.
4. **Keep the blast radius per key.** One key per agent, never a shared fleet
   key, so a single recovered key impersonates one agent rather than all of
   them. Drydock's name binding already enforces this for edge mode.

Rotation is not a lesser substitute for post-quantum signatures. For this
specific threat it attacks the exposure window directly, and it is available now
rather than after a two-repo protocol change.

## 9. Reproducing the measurements

Nothing in this section is committed. To re-measure, create a throwaway module
outside the repo with `go 1.27` and a benchmark that:

1. Signs the 129-byte canonical string from section 2.1 with
   `ed25519.Sign` and with `mldsa.GenerateKey(mldsa.MLDSA87()).Sign` using an
   empty `&mldsa.Options{}`.
2. Reports `len(sig)`, `len(pk.Bytes())`, and their base64url and standard-base64
   encoded lengths.
3. Benchmarks sign, verify, and keygen for Ed25519, ML-DSA-65, and ML-DSA-87,
   plus a hybrid case that signs with both and verifies both.
4. Runs `go test -run '^$' -bench . -benchtime 2s -count 5` and takes the median.

For the interoperability check in section 3.5, have the Go side write the raw
public key, signature, and message as hex; on the Node side wrap the raw public
key with the 22-byte SPKI prefix, `createPublicKey({format: "der", type:
"spki"})`, and `verify(null, msg, pubKey, sig)`. Then reverse the direction with
`generateKeyPairSync("ml-dsa-87")` and `mldsa.NewPublicKey` on the Go side.

Re-run this before acting on any trigger in section 7. The numbers are toolchain
and hardware specific, and `crypto/mldsa` is new enough that its performance is
likely to improve.
